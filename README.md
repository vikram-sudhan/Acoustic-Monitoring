Project Overview
The Acoustic Monitoring System is designed to detect, analyze, and monitor sound signals from the surrounding environment. It helps in identifying abnormal or significant acoustic events such as noise disturbances, machine faults, or environmental sound changes.
This project is suitable for applications like industrial monitoring, security systems, environmental noise analysis, and smart sensing applications.
⚙️ Working Principle
A microphone / sound sensor captures ambient sound.
The signal is processed by a microcontroller.
Sound levels or patterns are analyzed in real time.
When the sound crosses a predefined threshold, the system can trigger alerts or log data.
Output can be viewed through serial monitor, display, or IoT dashboard.
